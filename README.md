Gaussian Process Project for the course: Project in Data Science 1DL505. 
  
Main tasks:   
:purple_circle: Learn about making GPs using https://gpytorch.ai/  
:purple_circle: Learn about inducing points and implement them with gpytorch  
:purple_circle: Craft kernels to match the datasets  
:purple_circle: Measure the difference of speed with and without inducing points
